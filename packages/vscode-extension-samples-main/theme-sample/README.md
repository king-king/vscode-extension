# Theme Samples

This sample color theme extension contains two TextMate themes. 

Text Mate themes describe the theming rules used for syntax highlighting. Each rule consists of one or more scope selectors and a set of styles. To learn more about scopes and how they're used, check out the [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme) documentation.

You can directly use .tmTheme files in your extensions or import/convert them with VS Code's extension generator [yo code](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).
